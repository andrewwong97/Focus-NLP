# focus

Compilation of programs I wrote for a high school senior research project using NLP, combining predictive analytics and textual information in college applications.

Here are the questions I attempted to answer. This repository includes some of my final programs written for this project (#5, 6).

	1.	Does there exist a model for holistic admissions? 
	2.	Could focusing mainly on predictive analytics help find student fit?
	3.	How can we apply existing predictive analytics methods to college admissions data?
	4.	How can input from admissions officers improve my research of a model for student fit?
	5.	Can real college admissions data be analyzed with programming?
	6.	How can textual data (essays and recommendations) be analyzed?
	7.	How can we combine predictive and textual analyses in a comprehensive scientific model?
